# Huffman Coding Implementation Guide in Java (OOP Approach)

Detailed step-by-step guide to implement Huffman coding in Java using an object-oriented approach without external libraries:

## Question 1(a): Create a Huffman coding program

### Step 1: Define the core classes
- Create a `Node` class to represent tree nodes
  - Include fields for character, frequency, left child, and right child
  - Implement Comparable interface to allow sorting by frequency

- Create a `HuffmanTree` class to build and manage the Huffman tree
  - Include methods to build the tree from frequency data
  - Include methods to traverse the tree and generate codes

- Create a `HuffmanCoder` class as the main utility class
  - This will be responsible for the entire encoding process

### Step 2: Implement frequency calculation
- Create a method to count character frequencies in the input text
- Store the frequencies in a HashMap<Character, Integer>

### Step 3: Build the Huffman tree
- Create a priority queue to hold nodes, sorted by frequency
- Add all characters as initial nodes to the queue
- While the queue has more than one node:
  - Remove the two nodes with lowest frequencies
  - Create a new internal node with these two as children
  - Set the new node's frequency as the sum of its children
  - Add the new node back to the queue
- The last remaining node is the root of the Huffman tree

### Step 4: Generate Huffman codes
- Create a method to traverse the tree and build codes
- Use a HashMap<Character, String> to store the codes
- Traverse from root to leaves, adding "0" for left paths and "1" for right paths
- When reaching a leaf node, store the complete path as the code for that character

### Step 5: Create a method to get the Huffman code mapping
- Return the HashMap<Character, String> containing all character codes

## Question 1(b): Encode text using Huffman codes

### Step 1: Create an encoder method
- Take input text and Huffman codes as parameters
- Process each character in the input text
- Replace each character with its corresponding Huffman code
- Return the encoded binary string

### Step 2: Implement a method to save encoded data to a file (optional)
- Convert the binary string to a more efficient format (bit-packed)
- Save the compressed data to a file
- Include the Huffman code table in the file for later decompression

## Question 1(c): Decode text using Huffman codes

### Step 1: Create a decoder method
- Take the encoded string and Huffman tree as parameters
- Start at the root of the Huffman tree
- For each bit in the encoded string:
  - If "0", move to the left child
  - If "1", move to the right child
  - If a leaf node is reached, output the character and reset to the root

### Step 2: Implement a method to load encoded data from a file (optional)
- Read the Huffman code table from the file
- Read the compressed data
- Decompress using the decoder method

## Implementation considerations

### Error handling
- Add validation for input data
- Handle cases where input contains characters not in the original frequency set

### Memory management
- For large files, consider processing in chunks rather than loading entire files into memory

### Performance optimization
- Use a bit-packed representation for the encoded data instead of a string of "0"s and "1"s
- Consider using byte arrays for storing the encoded data
- Implement tree traversal iteratively instead of recursively for very large trees

### Code organization
- Separate encoder and decoder responsibilities
- Create utility methods for file I/O operations
- Add documentation to explain the algorithm and usage
